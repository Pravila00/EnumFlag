# EnumFlag C++
- This C++ code provides a template for enabling bitwise operations on enum classes, which are not supported by default in C++. It defines bitwise operators such as OR (|), AND (&), XOR (^), NOT (~), and compound assignment versions of these (|=, &=, ^=), as well as a modulus operator (%) to check if a particular bit is set.
